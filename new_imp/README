This directory, new_imp, contains the new implementation of the Fenix
Data Recovery interface, authored by Carson Mould.  The files in this 
directory will replace the files of similar names in the current code
when this implementation is near completion.

Thus far, many of the currently implemented functions and global variables
have been copied over into this implementation.  While the current
implementation does not work properly and is overly complex
in its use of versioning, a lot of its code is functional
and will be reused as much as possible.
